## About me:

Changing something in your life is quite a difficult step for many of us. After 6 years of studying chemistry, I realized that I hate chemistry. I decided to try something new. It was fascinating to watch how you can change font, color, size of a caption by just writing some code. Also, success of many people inspire to move forward. I am glad to be here and take part of this EPAM project.
